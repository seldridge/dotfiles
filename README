Contains configuration files used across multiple machines:

.bashrc

.elisp - contains all the additional features that I use in emacs,
  specifically, verilog-mode and icicles.

.emacs

.emacs.symlink_fix - rough fix to get around the Windows version of
  emacs disliking symlinks. This should go in you home folder to cause
  emacs to load the actual .emacs file in ~/dotfiles/.emacs.
